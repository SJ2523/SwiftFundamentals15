## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

var UserNm = "SJ"
print("I chose var because more than one person will use the app, so the name will change")
var UserAge = 48
  print ("Different users will have different ages.")
var NumofSteps = 6500
     print("The number of steps will vary.")
var NumofStepsGoal = 15000
     print("The number of steps goals will differ from person to person.")
var AvgHrtRt = 76
     print("The average heart rate will differ from person to person.")


/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
